        <h2>Check-in</h2>
        <p> Check-in is after 4:00 PM but should you desire to drop your bags, we can usually accommodate. Most days
            check in can be earlier, but you’ll need to ask and we can’t guarantee.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Check-out</h2>
        <p>Check-out is at 10:30 AM unless otherwise scheduled. There are no chores other than closing the door on your way out. (Unless you smoke and/or have pets, see
            those sections).</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Trash Receptacle vs. Recycling Bin</h2>
        <p>The trash receptacle is black, the recycling bin is turquoise. Please recycle only bottles, cans, and clean
            paper/cardboard. All else goes in the black bin. (See notes for pet waste and cigarette butts in those
            sections).</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Smoking</h2>
        <p>Absolutely no smoking in the suite. Smoking of any kind is allowed on the pool deck / patio or outside the
            screened area. If you smoke herb, remember that we can smell strong odors, so please open and close the
            container as rapidly as possible. When smoking on the patio, please close the room door. An ashtray is
            placed on the patio windowsill for your use, please bag your butts/ashes on your last morning with us and
            dispose of them in the black garbage bin.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Laundry</h2>
        <p>Our washer and dryer are available for your use. We offer scent free detergent, softener, and dryer sheets.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Parking</h2>
        <p>Please park on the left side of the driveway up to the cone, the cone lets you know you’ve reached the
            correct address and also prevents blocking either sidewalk.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Pool</h2>
        <p>We encourage you to use the pool as often as you like, we love it and use it 4 nights a week during summer
            and at least twice a week during winter. There is no fee for using the pool, however, please be safe and if
            you have young children, please be cautious. The tan cabinet just outside your door contains pool use
            supplies such as towels, hats, sunscreen, bottle openers, koozies, inflatables, etc. You may use anything in
            the cabinet.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Hot Tub</h2>
        <p>The hot tub is also available for your use, (ask us for the controller), and incurs a fuel fee depending on
            the temperature, (winter use is expensive), and how much you use it. We have an accurate app that tells us
            how many liters are used - fuel prices change with each fill so the cost is determined for each guest. As a
            guide only, winter use costs about $19 / hour, summer use is closer to $5 / hour. The system is programmed
            to stay on for two hours, so if it shuts down while you are still enjoying the tub, just press the “spa”
            button again. Once you get out, press the “pool” button. Payment is required in advance.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Walking</h2>
        <p>Our neighborhood is very safe and very walkable – enjoy if you wish. You will notice walkers, bikers,
            joggers etc. every day of your stay. Please don’t park in a manner that blocks the sidewalk.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Gardens</h2>
        <p>Ask about our local botanical gardens, we’ve been to them all.</p>

        <h1>Pets</h1>
        <p>Well behaved pets are welcome. Please collect pet waste and place the collection bags on the opposite side of
            the sidewalk from the black garbage can; on the day the city collects garbage, I will collect the bags and
            dispose of them.</p>

        <h1>Restaurants</h1>
        <p>There are literally hundreds of restaurants within 5 miles. Here are a few of our favorites that are less
            than 3 miles away. If you see a restaurant that you are interested in, ask us - we may have eaten there. On
            the other hand, restaurants are changing and opening rapidly and there are many we’ve not tried. Fine dining
            establishments are further away so are listed at the end.</p>
        <p>We whole-heartedly recommend the following nearby establishments organized by distance from our house:</p>

                <p> Every meal comes with three sauces, none of them overly spicy, but if you ask, you can get a very
                    spicy sauce. When we leave, all of the sauces are usually gone, eaten with our french fries and/or
                    our chicken. French fries come with a few frankfurters cut up about an inch long.</p>
